## Overview

This folder is designated for all API backend services. The purpose of this directory is to maintain a clean and
organized structure by centralizing all backend service logic, including APIs.

## Structure

The services folder can be organized into different subdirectories, each representing a specific service or module
within the backend.

## Purpose

The primary goal of the services folder is to:

- **Centralize Backend Logic**: Keep all backend service logic in one place to maintain a clear separation of concerns.
- **Promote Reusability**: Ensure that backend logic can be easily reused and maintained.
- **Enhance Organization**: Improve the structure and organization of the backend codebase, making it easier to navigate and
  manage.
