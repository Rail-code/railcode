## Overview

This folder contains packages that are designed to be shared across both web and backend services. The purpose of this
directory is to maintain a clean and organized structure by centralizing reusable logic and components.

## Structure

The packages folder is divided into three main subdirectories:

- **hooks**: Contains custom hooks to be used within React applications.
- **ui**: Contains reusable UI components.
- **utils**: Contains utility functions and helpers that can be used across different parts of the application, both
  frontend and backend.

## Purpose

The primary goal of the packages folder is to promote code reuse and consistency across the entire codebase. By having a
centralized location for hooks, UI components, and utility functions, we ensure that:

- **Consistency**: All parts of the application use the same logic and components, reducing bugs and inconsistencies.
- **Reusability**: Code can be reused across different projects and environments, including both web and backend services.
- **Maintainability**: Updates and changes to the logic or components only need to be made in one place, simplifying
  maintenance.
